    "This notebook will build the multi-layer structure described in Raman $et$ $al.$, Nature 515, 540-546 (2014), compute plot its emissivity in the solar region and in the atmospheric transmissivity region of the spectrum (~300-2500 nm for the former, 2500-20000 nm for the latter), and compute the cooling power for several different differences between the temperature of the structure and the ambient temperature.  \n",

    "Two differences between this notebook and the structure described in Raman $et$ $al.$ to note: (1) in this example, we terminate the multilayer at the optically thick Ag layer; the full structure described by Raman $et$ $al.$ involved was grown on a silicon substrate and included a thin (10 nm) titanium adhesion layer. Due to the very small skin depth of silver in the visible and IR, these layers make virtually no contribution to the optical properties of the stack.  To confirm there is negligible transmission through the terminal silver layer, one can plot the transmissivity of the multilayer by uncommenting the indicated lines below to confirm no visible or IR light is transmissited through the stack. (2) The refractive index data for materials described by Raman $et$ $al.$ are determined by ellipsometry on as-fabricated materials, and likely differ from the refractive index data employed by WPTherml.

Here we have a high-level method called `.compute_cooling_gradient()` that will compute the gradients of $P_{cool}, P_{rad}, P_{sun}, P_{atm}$ with respect to the thickenss of each layer.  This can be used to do gradient-based local optimizations of structures for any of these desired figures of merit.  You can also leverage these in global optimizations that perform multiple gradient-based optimizations, with one example being the Basin Hopping algorithm.  Here we will demonstrate the local gradient-based optimization using the L-BFGS-B method, where this algorithm also supports upper- and lower-bounds on the layer thicknesses so that the structures geometries can be constrained to be realistic.  \n",
